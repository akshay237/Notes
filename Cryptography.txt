														Security and Cryptography

  	- 	    Alice                               Bob
   	      (Sender)			                (Reciever)
   (Message,key)  -------Encrypted------>(Message) -------Decrypted------> (Message,key)
    - Ceaser Cipher:
		- In ceaser cipher the plain text is converted into the encrypyted with help of key.
		- The size of key is 3.
		- The characters are replaced by a difference of 3.
		- eg: YOU  ------Encrypted-------> BRX -------Decrypted------> You
		
		- Algo of ceaser cipher is mapping.
		
		Weakness:
			- There are only 26 keys here.
			- If they know the algo, they can break the text.
		
		- The security of ceaser cipher depends on keeping the algorithm secret.
			
	- Kerckhoff's Principle:
		- The attackers should not be able to break the ciphers even if they know the algroithm or cipher.
		
		
	- Substitution Cipher:
		- A substitution cipher is a ceaser cipher with more no of keys.
		- Asubstitution cipher have 26! permutations.
		- pow(2,88) less than 26! so we have a security of 88 bits
		
	- XOR operation:
		- is used for encrypting and decrypting
		- message ^ random = cipher
		- cipher ^ random = message
		- Here random is the key which helps in decryption and encryption.
		
		- If we take plain text of same length and than we guess the key by xor with cipher and again xor the key with cipher we get any plain text.
		
		4 - 0100
		8 - 1000
		
	- Stream Ciphers: In stream cipher a stream of bits passed as key.
		- A stream cipher is like a OneTimePad
		- No requirements on key stream
		- Hence, not true randomness
		- Also, can resuse key stream
		
		- We use LCG(Linear Constrained Generator) because it generates the same pseudo random integers
		
		- Challenges:
			- Autenticity - MAC
			- Reuse key
			- Low entropy
			
		- We can modify the encrypted text by changing the bits of encrypted text.
		
	
	- Block Cipher:
		- Instead of key stream blocks are used 
		- For DES block size is 8 bytes
		- If the block size is not of 8 bytes than we have to pad it with zero  -> Padding
