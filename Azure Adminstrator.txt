																			### Azure Administrator ###
																			
	- PowerShell and CLI
		- Scripting is used for automation
		- reduce errors on repetitve tasks
		- form of documentation
		
		- Basic CLI Commands:
			- az service_name list: list all services
			- az service_name create: create
			- az service_name delete: delete
			eg: az vm list: list all the VMs
				az vm create: create a new vm
				az cm delete: delete a new vm
				
		- PowerShell Commands:
			- Get-AzVM: list all the VMs
			- New-AzVM: create a new VM
			- Remove-AzVM: removes a VM
			
	- Azure AD:
		- Cloud first or cloud only active directory.
		- For remote branches with limited on perm-infrastructure
		
		- Azure Directory Identity Protection:
			- it is a series of machine learning algorithm that will analyze the users, logins and any vunerabilities
			
		- Conditional Access:
			- We can provide different conditions for the sign in
			- The platform device like Windows, Android, iOS
			- We can give the geographical location
			
		- Access Review:
			- Review and reduce employee and guest's group memberships and access to enterprise applications
			- Organize and track review for compliance and risk management
			- Clean up guest users in Office groups
		
		- Adminstrative units:
			- restricts permission in a role to any portion of your orqanization that you define
			
		- Local Administrator are added from the Devices blade section
		
		- Ways to assign access rights:
			- Direct Assignment: Assign a user the required access by directly assigning a rolt that has those rights.
			- Group Assignment: Assign a group the required access and member will inherit those rights.
			- Rule-based assignment: Use rules to determine a group membership based on user or device properties
			
		- Azure AD defines users in three ways:
			- Cloud Identities: Exist only in Azure AD. Administrator accs and users that you manage yourself.Their source is Azure Active directory and or External azure AD if defined in another azure AD
			- Directory-synchronized Identities: these users exist in on-premise Active directory. Source is Windows Server AD
			- Guest Users: These users exist outside Azure.
			
			
		~ Tenant:
			- A representation of an organization
			- Usually represented by a pulic domain name
			- A dedicated instance of Azure Active directory
			
		- Subscription:
			- An agreement with Microsoft to use Azure services and how to pay for that
				- Free Subscriptions
				- Pay as you go
				- Enterprise Agreements
				
		~~ Not every tenant needs to have a subscription
		~~ Tenants have more than one subscription
		
		~ Resource:
			- An entity managed by Azureeg: Virtual Machine, web app, storage account
			- Accounts can given read, update owner rights to rsources
			
		~ Resource Groups:
			- A way of organizing resources in a subscription
			- A folder structure
			- All resources must belong to one resource 
			- Resource group can be deleted
			- A way to seprating out projects
			- we can do budgeting and cost analyze
			
		- Resource locks:
			- we can add locks to the resources to prevent change it
			- we add read only lock
			
		- Azure Policy:
			- define policies to enforce company standards and SLAs
			- built-in Policies(appply certain conditions)
			- We can start the Policy Scan in the power shll(Start-AzPolicyComplianceScan resoucegroupname res)
			
			To define Policy through PowerShell:
				- Get-AzPolicyDefinition: displays all policy
				- Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq "Audit missing tag on resources" } : filters through all policies and displays whose name matches with given name
				- Assign the above to object by $ObjectName = above command
				- New-AzResourceGroup -Name "mynewrg" -Location "East US" : create a new resource
				  eg: $rg = Get-AzPolicyDefinition -Name 'mynewrg" -Location "East US"
					  To get the details of the resource we can by $rg.Resource, ResourceGroupName, ResourceId
					  
					  
	- Create and Configure Storage Accounts:

		- Storage Account:
			It is a container that groups a set of Azure Storage Service together.
			Azure Files, blobs, Queues and Tables.
			A stroage account defines a policy that applies to all the storage services in the account.

		- Disk Roles:
			- OS Disk: contains operating system of the virtual machine
			- Data Disk: add one or  more data virtual disks to each virtual machine to store data.
			- Temporary Disk: which is used for short-term storage applications such as page files and swap files.

			- Ephemoral OS disks: 
				- it is a virtual disk that saves data on the local virtual machine storage.
				- has faster read-and-write latency than a managed disk
				- work well when you want to host a stateless workload

			- Managed Disks:
				- a virtual hard disk for which azure manages all the required physical infrastructure.
				- They are Simply Scalable, High Availability, Integration with availability sets and zones, support for azure backup, granular access control

			- Unmanaged Disks:
				- it is like a managed disk is stored as a page blob in Azure Storage account. 

		- Access Keys: 
			- are used to authenticate your applications when making requests to this azure storage account.
			- Store your access keys securely.

		- Shared Access Signature:
			- A shared access signature is a URL that grants restricted access rights to Azure storage resources.
			- provides SAS to those clients who should not be trusted with your storage account key but whome you wish to delegate access to certain storage accounts
		
		- Storage Explorer:
			- It is a web based software that we can download and it connect to the storage account

		- Log Analytics:
			- Monitoring of the storage resources(upload of data, download, removal)
			- set the alert rule which gave alerts when certain limits will exceed
			- We have to add diagnotic for the new resource to diagnose
			- We can run the prewritten query 
			- Insights to show performance of storage account

		- Redundant Storage:
			- a copy of the storage is always made to protect from the transient failure
			- if a failure happen to a storage than the copy will be used to restore
			- We can redundant Locally or Geo-Redundant storage

		- The storage account secondary endpoint will become the primary endpoint after the failover completes.

		- Through RBAC also we can control the storage account.

		- Replication option for azure Storage:
			- Locally Redundant Storage
			- Geographically Redundant Storage
			- Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage
			- Zone Redundant Storage
			- Geo-zone Redundant Storage

		- AzCopy is a command line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account

		- Access Tier:
			- how much you charged for storage and for access
			- hot: default tier
			- cool: pay half for storage and pay double for access
			- archieve: has lowest charge for storage but higher data cost for access and it may take hours to retrieve

		- Lifecycle management offers a rich, rule-based policy for general purpose v2 and blob storage accounts

		- When object replication is enabled blobs are copied asynchronously from a source storage account to a destination account.
		- We have to setup import/export jobs to move large files.

		- CDN:
			- allows you to improve performance by removing the burden of serving static, unchanging files from the main server to a network of servers
			- reduce traffic to a server

		- Azure File Sync:
			- used as a file distribution service
			- to sync your server with azure file sync
			- used to centralize your organization's file shares in azure files, while keeping the flexibility, performance and comptability of an on-premises file  server.
			- Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your azure file share.

		- SMB Protocol requires TCP port 445 to be open, connections will fail if port 445 is blocked.

		- Azure Backup:
			- create a Recovery Services vault for backup.
			- choose the workload(azure, on-premises)
			- choose system for backup(VM, fileshare) 
			- choose the back up policy(specify all the scheduled information here)
			- Goal is prevent data loss by backing up virtual machine and other resources that stores data

		- File Recovery is used to pull particular file from the backup.

		- Backup Reports:
			- we can do the diagonstic and set the alerts for the backup
			- Pwer BI is used to view report, dashboard,download report and create custom report

		- Soft Delete:
			- Recovery Services Vault
			- Enabled by default on new RSV
			- 14 days to delete backup data
			- can be undelete

		- Azure Site Recovery:
			- it means replicating an Azure VM to a different Azure Region directly from the azure portal.
			- Site Recovery is automatically updated with the new azure features as they are released.
			- Minimize the recovery issues
			- keep application available during outages with automatic recovery



	- Azure Virtual Machine:
		- Availability Set:
			- fault domain: vm in same fault domain share a commom power source and physical network switch
			- updated domain: VM in the same update domain will be restarted together during planned maintenance. Azure never restart more than on update domain at same time.

		- Azure Monitoring collects host-level metrics-like CPU Utilization, disk and network usage for all virtual machines without any additional software.

		- If we want to add aditional configurations, agents, scripts or applications via virtual machine extension that will run after deployment of VM.
		- Custom Script Extension is a tool that can be used to automatically lunch and execute VM, customization tasks post configurations.

		- Azure Bastion Service:
			- a more secure way of connecting to a remote environment directly from the azure portal without requiring any public IP.

		- Virtual Machine Scale Set:
			- Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs.
			- The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.

		- Create VM through Power Shell:
			- To create new VM: New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "name_of _res_group" -Name "vm_name" -Location "location" -VirtualNetwork " " -SubnetName "default" 
			  -SecurityGroupName "name" -PublicIpAddressName "ipadd" -OpenPorts 80,443,3389
			- After creation we have to give user ceredentials

		- Stop and Start VM in PowerShell:
			- Stop: Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "name" -Name "name"
			- Start: Start-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "name" -Name "name"


	- We have a template file, we can download after the deployment is commplete.
	- Template is a json file contains parameters, variable, resources, version no and the $schema(mandatory field).

	- To modify an existing VM through ARM templates compulsory change these properties Network Interface Card, Public IP Address, Vitual Machine Name.
	- We can deploy using powershell and CLI commands and in portal too.

	- In the Azure VM the OS Disk is the temporary disk do not add permanent data to it will loose that.
	- Create and attach a new disk

	- Redeploy the VM using PowerShell:
		- Set-AzureRmVM -Redeploy -ResourceGroupName "az_name" -Name "vm_name" 
		- It will be redeployed to a different hardware cluster

	- For adding the Network Interface Card stop the VM first.
	- Recovery Servicw Vault is uswd to store the backup of the VM.
	- For each VM we need a backup policy to restore.


	- Azure App Services:
		- Web app is azure service. It is abstraction above the hardware.
		- App Service Web Apps lets you quickly build and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform.

		- App Service Plan:
			- where the different resources are constrained
			- It gives you flexibility to allocate specific apps to a given set of resources and further optimize your azure resource utilization.

		- Azure Compute Units(ACU) are dedicated computer resources used to run applications deployed in the App service plan.
		- Scale out and Scale Up are used when demands needs with certain conditions(Cpu utilization)

	- Azure Kubernetes Services:
		- This new service features an azure-hosted control plane, automated upgrades, self healing, easy scaling and a simple experience for both developers and cluster operations.

		- AKS Cluster:
			- manages your hosted kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise.


	- Virtual Networks:
		- Azure Virtual Network is the building block for your private network in Azure.
		- Vnet enables many types of Azure resources such as Azure VM to securely communicate with each other.

		- Route Table:
			- A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that specifies how packets should be routed in a virtual network.
			- Route table are associated to subnets and each packet leaving a subnet is handled based on the associated route table.

		- VPNs:
			- Join an outside machine or network to an azure network
			- end to end encryption of traffic
			- Able to access systems by their private IP address

			- ExpressRoute is a private connection to azure
			- Work with a communication provide for setup.

		- Firewall:
			- a managed cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network.
			- It is a fully stateful firewall as a service with built in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.

		- Custom routes are used to override default Azure routing so that you can route traffic through network virtual appliance

		- Peering: Add one virtual network to the another so resources in both networks can connect with each other.

		- Azure VPN Gateway enables you to establish secure, cross-premises connectivity between your virtual network within Azure and on-premise IT infrastructure.

	- Azure DNS:
		- Azure Provided DNS:
			- No Configuration required
			- Can use hostnames to connect to machines on same Vnet
			- A VM can refer to another VM on the same network just by its hostname without requiring a fully domain name.
			- allows you to host your registered domains.

		- Azure Private DNS:
			- create your own custom domain names and have them recognized by your VMs
			- only valid on your own virtual network
			- Label.label format
			- A Private DNS zone provides name resolution service within virtual networks.

		- A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain. 
		- The A recors maps a custom domain to an IP address


		- A network security group can have a multiple network interfaces assigned to it.

	- Load Balancing:
		- divides the traffic to multiple resources
		- Azure Load balancer is a layer 4 load balancer that distributes incoming traffic among healthy virtual machine instances.
		- Five-tuple hash is the distribution traffic pass through the load balancer.

	- Application Gateway:
		- It provides an azure managed HTTP load balancing solution and onlayer-7 load balancing

	- BackEnd pool:
		- It is a collection of resources to which your application gateway can send traffic.
		- A backend pool can contain virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, IP addresses, domain names

	- Network Watcher:
		- It is a regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level.
		- Network Watcher IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine based on a 5-tuple information.
		- The security group decision and the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned.
		- IP Flow Verify is used to diagnose the security group issues.
		- Network Watcher variable packet capture allows you to create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine.
		- Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactivity.
		- Log Analytics is used to analyze traffic .

	- With help of Azure Monitor we get more visibility into the health and performance of your virtual machine.
	- Enabling additional monitoring capabilities provides insights into the performance and dependencies for your virtual machine.
