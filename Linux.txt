																		### Linux ###

	~ File System Paths:
	 	- Absolute : it begins with "/" and indicates path start at the root directory.
	 	- Relative : it not begins with "/" and identifies a locn relative to current location

	- Directory listing Attributes:
		- drwxr_xr_x : 10 charcters(d - directory, l-link, - : file)

	 - Error redirects:
	 	- ls -l /root 2> errorfile (The 2> redirect the error to the errorfile)

	 - Linux file types:
	 	- There are 7 types of file in linux:
	 		- : Regular file
	 		d : directory
	 		l : link
	 		c : special or device file
	 		s : socket
	 		p : Named pipe
	 		b : block device

	 - find and locate command: 
	 		find . -name "filename" (Here . means search from current directory)
	 		locate filename

	 		find: it iterates over a file system to locate the files
	 		locate: it uses a prebuilt database which is regularly updated
	 		Note: To use locate update the db by the root user(updatedb)

	 - Change Password:
	 	- passwd userid

	 - WildCards:
	 	* - represents zero or more character
	 	? - represent a single character
	 	[] - represent a range of character

	 - Soft and Hard links:
	 	inode: pointer or number of file on the hard disk
	 	soft link: link will be removed if the files removed or renamed(ln -s)
	 	hard link: deleting, renaming or removing file will not affect the hard link(ln )

	 	ls -ltri : it gives the link with no of inodes

	 - Recursive ownership change option(Cascade):
	 	~ -R : if we use chown or chgrp with -R option it will not change only that directory but all the files and directories in that directory.
	 	~ chgrp : to change group

	 - Access Control List(ACL):
	 	- provides an additional more flexible permission mechanism for file system.
	 	- it allows you to give permission for any user or group to any disc resource.

	 	commands to assign and remove ACL permissions:
	 		- setfacl
	 		- getfacl

	 	1. Set permission to user:
	 		setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file

	 	2. To add permission for a group.
	 		setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file

	 	3. To remove a specific entry.
	 		setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file

	 	4. To remove all entries.
	 		setfacl -b path/to/file


	- Help Commands:
		- There are 3 types of help commands:
			~ whatis command
			~ command --help
			~ man command

	- tee Command:
		- standard o/p to a file
		- used to store and view the o/p of any command
		- used with pipe command(echo "o/p" | tee filename)
		- If we want to append something to that file(echo "o/p" | tee -a filename)

	- Pipe(|) Command:
		- it connects the o/p of one command directly to the input of another command
		- the Pipe command run in the sub shell and it will executes firstly
		- rm -Rf : it will forcefully remove sub-directories and it's contents as well

	- File display command:
		- cat
		- more
		- less
		- head
		- tail

	- Compress and uncompress file:
		- tar: used to compress the file( tar cvf backup.tar .)
		- gzip:
		- gzip -d:

			- These commands helps in the transfer of data b/w remote system becz by zipping the file size is reduced.

	- Truncate file size:
		- used to shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified size
		- truncate -s 10 filename


	- Combining and splitting files:
		- split command is used to split files
		  split -l 300 file.txt childfile.txt
		- multiple files combined to one by using redirection operator


	- User Account Management:
		- useradd
		- groupadd
		- userdel
		- groupdel
		- usermod

	- Switch users:
		- su -username
		- sudo
		- visudo : configuration file wehere we change configurations for the different users
		- fdisk : gives the details about disks

	- Monitor users:
		- who, last, w, finger, id

	- Talking to users:
		- wall: it is used to broadcast message to all other users.
			- type wall in your terminal and than enter and write the message you want to broadcast.	

		- write: If we want to give a message to the particular user than write.
			- write username and enter than type the broadcast the message

	-which: it tells where the command is located
	- cal: it is calendar command gives information about calender(cal month(0..12) year)

	- Process/ Services Command:
		~ systemctl or service
		~ ps 
		~ top

	~ Process Management:
		~ background: (bg) put the job in the background
		~ foreground: (fg) gets back the process in the foreground
		~ Run process even after exit: nohup proccess &
		~ nice: this command is used to give priority to any process

	~ System Monitoring Commands:
		~ top, df, dmesg, iostat, netstat, free, cat /proc/cpuinfo, cat /proc/memoinfo
		~ df -h: memory info
		~ df -sh * : it also gives memory info for each file in a directory

	~ Log Monitoring:
		- log directory: /var/log


	- ethtool - find details about NIC interface
	- nmcli - used for network manager command line interface
	- nmtui - used for network manager text user interface
	- nm-connections-editor - provide access to most of network management configuration 
	- GNOME Settings: the network settings of GNOME 


	~ Remote Synchronization:
		- use ssh utility for sending the files
		  rsync options source destination
		  eg: rsync -azvh /home/dir /destunation_dir

	~ System Update and Repos:
		apt-get : for update and upgrade
		rpm: after download when we want to install use rpm or used when no internet connection

	~ update: preserves old packages
	~ upgrade: delete old packages

	~ Commands used for DNS lookup:
		- nslookup
		- dig

	~ To display image through command line:
		- first install imageMagick package
		- display image_file

	~ Configure Idle timeout in ssh
		- for that edit the sshd-config file 

	~ Access remote server without password
		- generate the key(ssh-keygen)
		- copy the key to the server(ssh-copy-id root@ip)
		- now while loggin from client you don't need passwd

	~ System Run Level:
		- We use system run level with init command(init no)
		- There are total 6 system run level in linux
		- Main Run level:
			- 0 : Shut down or halt the system
			- 1 : single user mode  
			- 6 : Reboot the system
		- Other Run level:
			- 2 : Multiuser mode without networking
			- 3 : Multiuser mode with networking
			- 5 : Multiuser mode with networking and GUI

	~ Linux Boot Process:
		BIOS --> it executes Master Boot Record
		MBR --> it executes GRUB
		GRUB --> the GRUB executes the kernel
		kernel --> the kernel executes sbin/init
		Init --> it executes the run level programs
		Runlevel --> run level programs executed from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/

		who -r : it tells in which run level we are

	~ Disk Partition:
		~ df -h
		~ fdisk -l 

	~ Adding a new disk Partition:
		~ fdisk new_partiton_name
		~ type m to get all options
		~ type n for partition type
		~ type p for primary partition
		~ then type enter by seeing the o/p
		~ type w to write table to disk and exit

	~ Assign file system type:
		~ mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1

	~ Mount the created partition
		~ mount partiton_name dir_where_to partition

	~ To unmount
		~ umount dir_where_mounted

    ~ LVM(Logical Volume Management):
    	- allows disks to combine together

    	~ Mount point to be selected if configuring LVM:
    		- /home
    		- /var
    		- /boot
    		- /swap
    		- / - in last select this one and give all left memory

    ~ Swap space:
    	- Recommended Swap size = Twice the size of RAM
    	Commands to make swap:
    	 - dd
    	 - mkswap
    	 - swapon or swapoff

    ~ RAID(Redundant Array of Independent Disks):
    	RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or 
	solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure. 
	RAID employs the techniques of disk mirroring or disk striping. Mirroring will copy identical data onto more than one drive. 
	Striping partitions help spread data over multiple disk drives. Each drive's storage space is divided into units ranging from a sector of 512 bytes
    	- Types of RAID:
    		- RAID0:
    			- Here we add up the disks to increase size and the read write operation
    			- But in case of disk failure we loose data
    		- RAID1:
    			- Here we mirror the first disk with the second one
    			- But the read/write operation are slow
    			- We have data in case of disk failure
    		- RAID5
    			- Here we add the disk and do the mirroring and data striping also
    			- We have more memory and read/write operation
    			- it solves the problem of both the cases

    ~ Linux fsck utility is used to check and repair linux file systems(ext2, ext3, ext4)
    ~ Linux xfs_repair utility is used to check and repair linux file system for xfs file system type

    Thr possible exit code for fsck:
    	- 0 : No errors 
    	- 1 : Filesystem errors corrected
    	- 2 : System should be rebooted
    	- 4 : FileSystem error left uncorrected
    	- 8 : Operational error
    	- 16 : Usage or syntax error
    	- 32 : fsck cancelled by user request
    	- 128 : Shared library error

    	-df -T : it tells the type of file system

    	- for xfs_repair we have to unmout the partition if it's mounted

    ~ To backup or clone an entire hard disk
      dd  if=<source file name> of=<target file name> [options]

    ~ To backup copy disk partition
      dd if=partition_name of=partition.img

   ~ Change file creation Permission:
   	 - umask : command to set default permission of any newly created file/directory
   	   syntax: umask u+rw,g+r,o-rwx

   ~ If the file system is corrupted than it would be corrupted in one of the file system.

   ~ Troubleshooting steps for Slow Performance:
   		- Disk Space issues: df -h, du -sh *
   		- Processing: top, free, lsmem, /proc/meminfo, vmstat, pmap <PID>, dmidecode, lscpu
   		- Disk Issues: iostat -y 5, lsof
   		- Networking: tcpdump -i enps03, lsof -i -P -n | grep -i listen, netstat -plnt or ss -plnt, iftop
   		- Other tools: htop, iotop, iptraf, psacct


   ~ SELinux:
   		- It is a linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control policies
   		- SELinux options:
   				- Enforcing: Enabled 
   				- Permissive: Disabled but logs the activity
   				- Disable: Disable and not activity the logs

   		- Check SELinux status:
   				- sestatus or getenforce
   				
   		- SELinux setting:
   				- setenforce 0 = Permissive/Disable
   				- setenforce 1 = Enable

   		- Modify SELinux config file for permanent change: 
   				- /etc/selinux/config
   					SELINUX=enforcing
   					SELINUX=disabled

   		- Two main concepts of SELinux:
   				- Labeling 						--> User:role:type:level
   				- Type enforcement

   				- to list label of a directory: ls -dZ /usr/sbin/httpd (for file instead of d put l)
